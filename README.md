A word game imitating a fond one from childhood. This will be fun.

## Running the Game

Yeah, it's written in JavaScript.

## Code Style

- Tabs for indentation
	- Spaces to align arguments
- Braces in [1TBS style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS)
- CamelCase preferred
- Semicolons everywhere
- Otherwise, follow [airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org) for documentation, with markdown.
